Self analysis app (iOS)
=======================

A solution to a tiny problem. How to regularly assess yourself by following a fixed list of questions and keep track of your answers.

There is no fixed interval at which you must do the assessment.

Inspiration and questions came from a relatively old book 'Think and Grow Rich' written by Napoleon Hill in 1937.

You can get the app on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/self-analysis/id1550503112)
